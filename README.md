# A-Star
1. Spend a moment on some external research on using "A* pathfinding" - a very important and useful pathfinding algorithms - in your code.
2. Using your research, write an A* implementation that reads coordinates labeled (x,y,cost) where x &amp; y are letters that define a connection,
and cost is a number that represents the cost. You can use the below information:
Sample map to traverse:  (a,b,5) (b,c,1) (a,d,7) (c,d,1) - Sample path request: (a,d)
3. The program should determine if it's possible to reach a destination given the starting point.
It should also find the cheapest path, making sure to output the cost of the path.
